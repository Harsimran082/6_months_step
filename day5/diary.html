    <h3>Pagination</h3>
        <p>If you have a web site with lots of pages, you may wish to add some sort of pagination to each page.</p>
        <p>The .active class is used to "highlight" the current page.</p>
        <p>The .disabled class is used for un-clickable links.</p>
        <p>Add class .pagination-lg for larger blocks or .pagination-sm for smaller blocks.</p>
        <p>Use utility classes to change the alignment of the pagination.</p>
    <h3>Cards</h3>
        <p>A card in Bootstrap 5 is a bordered box with some padding around its content. It includes options for headers, footers, content, colors, etc.</p>
        <p>A basic card is created with the .card class, and content inside the card has a .card-body class.</p>
        <p>The .card-header class adds a heading to the card and the .card-footer class adds a footer to the card.</p>
        <p>To add a background color to the card, use contextual classes .bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light.</p>
    <h3>Dropdown</h3>
        <p>A dropdown menu is a toggleable menu that allows the user to choose one value from a predefined list.</p>
        <p>The .dropdown class indicates a dropdown menu. To open the dropdown menu, use a button or a link with a class of .dropdown-toggle and the data-bs-toggle="dropdown" attribute. Add the .dropdown-menu class to a container element, like div or ul, to actually build the dropdown menu. Then add the .dropdown-item class to each element (links or buttons) inside the dropdown menu.</p>
        <p>The .dropdown-divider class is used to separate links inside the dropdown menu with a thin horizontal border.</p>
        <p>If you want the dropdown menu to expand upwards instead of downwards, change the div element with class="dropdown" to "dropup".</p>
    <h3>Navbar</h3> 
        <p>A navigation bar is a navigation header that is placed at the top of the page.</p>
        <p>With Bootstrap, a navigation bar can extend or collapse, depending on the screen size.</p>
        <p>A standard navigation bar is created with the .navbar class, followed by a responsive collapsing class: .navbar-expand-xxl|xl|lg|md|sm (stacks the navbar vertically on xxlarge, extra large, large, medium or small screens).</p> 
        <p>To add links inside the navbar, use either an ul element (or a div) with class="navbar-nav". Then add li elements with a .nav-item class followed by an a element with a .nav-link class.</p>
        <p>Navbars can also hold dropdown menus.</p>
