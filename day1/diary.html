        <h3>Introduction to HTML</h3>
            <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <br>
            HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. <br>
            HTML describes the structure of a Web page. <br>
            HTML consists of a series of elements. <br>
            HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. <br>
            HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
        <h3>Introduction to CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. <br>
                CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. <br>
                CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</p>
