        <h3>Introduction to Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development.Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins. Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs</p>
            <p>Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.</p>
        <h3>Containers</h3>
            <p>Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes available. The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container. The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.</p>
            <p>By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. For example, .pt-5 means "add a large top padding".</p>
        <h3>Grid System</h3>
            <p>Bootstrap's grid system is built with flexbox and allows up to 12 columns across the page. If we do not want to use all 12 columns individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns.</p>
            <p>The Bootstrap 5 grid system has six classes: <br>
                .col- (extra small devices - screen width less than 576px) <br>
                .col-sm- (small devices - screen width equal to or greater than 576px) <br>
                .col-md- (medium devices - screen width equal to or greater than 768px) <br>
                .col-lg- (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px) <br>
                .col-xl- (xlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px) <br>
                .col-xxl- (xxlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1400px)</p>
